# MacGyver

_*What Would MacGyver Do?*_

MacGyver is a container image that contains a few key configuration and network utilities that allow the easy setup and troubleshooting of custom networking within OpenShift.

MacGyver was built to provide a method of running tools such as `ethtool` on Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) systems, as used for worker/compute nodes within OpenShift, by leveraging the default Machine Config Operator method of managing underlying system resources.

Simple examples are available in the `examples` directory.
